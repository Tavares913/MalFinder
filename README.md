MalFinder is a simple app that lets you find users with similar interests on myanimelist.

For future: items = anime/manga/characters/people.

You have two search options:

Friend list: Search someone's friend list to find the users in that list that have the most favourited items in common with you (useful for users with very long friend lists).

Tree search: A breadth first tree search of that user's friends (only checking the first 10 friends of each user) starting with a specified user.
